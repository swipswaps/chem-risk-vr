# ChemRisk
The core concept of this game lies in the presentation of laboratory safety requirements with certain gamification elements, so as to assist students in the science, biology, and chemistry fields in better recalling them during classes. The game is designed to be a single-player experience in a virtual reality headset environment. This project was a concept my team and I implemented in order to satisfy our client.

The game allows multiple students to track their progression and stats on the same system by allowing them to create a user at the beginning. When creating their user, the player will be able to set a specific name or username for his user.
